# California Real Estate Licensee Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The Real Estate Licensee analysis uses the datasets from Department of Real Estate (DRE) in California to analyze the licensee and examinee of brokers and salespersons. Based on the recent five Fiscal years of DRE Licensee/Examinee statistics, we use a variety of visualization to explore the real estate business trend. Our goal is to provide a dashboard and recommendations with DRE, which can help the management to plan ahead for the next year and improve Real Estate licensing services.
